# Loopy Pro Musings

This is a place for me to share some things I'm doing or have done with [Loopy Pro](https://loopypro.com/).

My interest in Loopy Pro was prompted by a user on Facebook who wanted to use TouchOSC as a bridge between Loopy Pro and a Behringer X32 digital mixer. He wanted to use Loopy Pro to talk to TouchOSC and TouchOSC to talk to the X32. This "should" have worked except for the fact that TouchOSC stops running when put in the background on an iPad. A second iPad running TouchOSC wasn't an option.
